So, I had this job for a year that took up rather a lot of time and I haven't done any work and *angstquasiblogging* and all that. 
I don't think I'm coming back to this project for a while yet either, because of a different new one
with a better-defined end-goal.  In javascript, mostly.

# Watch Me Learn RubyOnRails!
## Embarassing myself on the internet

This then would by ruby_on_rails_exercise: RubyOnRailsExercise, to mix metaphors...
